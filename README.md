Recent technological advancements in the development of small at-home business have been on
the up scale. These small businesses are started by stay-at-home moms or women who are trying
to make a difference in the society instead of just being the type who stays at home and does
nothing but household chores. These small businesses take off generally within the person’s
social or city-spread vicinity. Now, the type of business and the products these small businesses
sell are too vast to be categorized as one type.
Our project mainly focuses on helping these stay-at-home moms to start or expand their line of
Home Baked Products which can be delivered to their customers within their desired distance
radius. We call this the ‘Home Bakery Delivery system’. We act as the bridge between the
product made and it getting delivered. This project of ours is not trying to fill the void of such a
specific system existing but also in contributing to the women empowerment rally. Our idea has
been represented in various software engineering methodologies and in an impeccable
object-oriented modeling design.

An online Home Bakery Delivery System that allows users to check for various bakery products
available at the home at that time and purchase online. It helps the sellers and customers to
interact with each other on online platforms. The project consists of a list of bakery products
displayed in various categories which are prepared at home. The user may browse through these
items as per categories. If the user likes a product he may place an order for it. He can then login
using the same id password next time. Now he may pay through a credit card or cash on delivery.
Once the user makes a successful transaction he gets a copy of the shopping receipt on his email
id. The middle tier or code behind the model is designed for fast processing. A backend to store
bakery products lists data. Thus, the online Bakery shopping project brings an entire bakery shop
online and makes it easy for both buyer and seller.
